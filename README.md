# <a href="https://github.com/akabor/pacman">Pacman</a>

## Project Description

This project is from week 4 of an MIT Professional Certificate in Coding course. If you've played any type of video game before, you're probably familiar with Pacman. My Pacman moves across and down the screen, resetting to the top of the screen once it reaches the bottom.

## Installation

Download all files to the same location on your computer. Drag and drop the pacmanV3.html file onto your browser and click on the image of Pacman.

## Roadmap

Future updates to this program will include a ghost chasing Pacman, and Pacman going back up the page. When Pacman goes back up the page, the ghost will flash indicating vulnerability. In this case, Pacman will be chasing the ghost.

# Pac-Man

## Project Description

This project is from week 4 of an MIT Professional Certificate in Coding course. If you've played any type of video game before, you're probably familiar with Pac-Man. My Pac-Man moves across and down the screen, resetting to the top of the screen once it reaches the bottom.

## Installation

Download all files to the same location on your computer. Drag and drop the pacmanV3.html file onto your browser and click on the image of Pac-Man.

## Roadmap

Future updates to this program will include a ghost chasing Pac-Man, and Pac-Man going back up the page. When Pac-Man goes back up the page, the ghost will flash indicating vulnerability. In this case, Pac-Man will be chasing the ghost.
